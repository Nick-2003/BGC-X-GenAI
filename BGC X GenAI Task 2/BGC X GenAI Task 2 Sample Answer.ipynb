    "This example demonstrates the core principles of developing a financial chatbot using rule-based logic. Depending on your depth of understanding and technical skills, there are numerous ways to enhance and expand this prototype. You might integrate more complex NLP features for natural language understanding, connect to real-time financial databases for dynamic data retrieval, or implement machine learning for more nuanced interaction and response generation.\n",

    "Key takeaway: The principles of chatbot development (rule-based logic, data integration, and clear communication) apply regardless of the complexity of your chatbot. This example provides a foundation, but the possibilities are vast, encouraging you to explore and innovate beyond this basic framework."
